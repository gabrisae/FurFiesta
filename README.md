# CIDM 3312 Final Project - Fur Fiesta
# Name: Gabriela Saenz
## Overview
For the final project in CIDM 3312, you are tasked with creating an ASP.NET Core application using EF Core. This project will integrate all skills and technologies learned throughout the class into one comprehensive web application.

## Project Requirements
- **Repository Setup:**
  - Create your own GitHub repository. There is no GitHub Classroom link.
  - Visit GitHub.com, click "New Repository", and assign a unique name to your repository.
  - Make your repository public so it can be viewed by others.
  - Share ideas and collaborate, but ensure all code is originally written by you.
  - Include a `.gitignore` file that excludes `bin/` and `obj/` directories.

- **Web Application Specifications:**
  - Implement at least **TWO** database tables as entity classes.
  - Follow steps 1-8 from Week 13 to create your project using ASP.NET Core with EF Core.
  - Use scaffolding on one of your entity classes (as specified in step 8).
  - Write code to display or modify related data (e.g., a course page lists students; student pages list courses they are enrolled in).
  - Implement functionality to add/drop courses through a form or button on the interface.
  - Seed the database with records for all entities, ensuring at least one entity has enough records (minimum 25) to demonstrate paging.
  - Add data validation to all necessary properties.
  - Implement paging on at least one Razor page, displaying ten records at a time with navigation controls.
  - Include a search bar on at least one Razor page to filter results based on user input.
  - Enable sorting and/or filtering of records on at least one page using ascending/descending options or a SelectList.
  - Ensure all relevant pages are linked in the navigation bar.

## Deliverables
